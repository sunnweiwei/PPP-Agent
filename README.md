# PPP-Agent: Training Proactive and Personalized LLM Agents

**PPP-Agent** is an open-source framework for training LLM agents that are not only productive (task success) but also **proactive** (ask essential clarifying questions) and **personalized** (adapt to diverse user preferences). It includes **UserVille**, an interactive environment that turns existing agent benchmarks into multi-turn, preference-aware simulations.

## Highlights

- **UserVille**: converts precise prompts into **vague** ones and simulates users with 20 configurable preferences.
- **PPP RL**: multi-objective RL optimizing **Productivity, Proactivity, Personalization** jointly.
- **Plug-and-Play Tools**: SWE (SWE-Bench & SWE-Gym) and Deep-Research (BrowseComp+) scaffolds.
- **User-Centric Metrics**: effort-based proactivity + preference-following personalization.
- **Generalization**: transfers to unseen preferences, simulators, and downstream tasks.
